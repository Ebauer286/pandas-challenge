# pandas-challenge
I completed the pandas challenge with assistance from Steven during office hours, tutoring sessions with Carlos as well as Xpert. I used Xpert to help outline the base structure of the code and Carlos helped with polishing the code as well as using the terminal to commit and push changees into github.
